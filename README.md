TASK OVERVIEW:

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

KEY INSIGHTS:

In Our analysis of the Titanic dataset, we uncovered crucial insights into the factors influencing survival rates. Specifically we found that passengar class and gender significantly impacted survival probabilities, with certain groups more likely to survive than others. Our utilization of data cleaning and EDA techniques has provided a foundation for informed decision-making in future analyses.
